## 🧠 DSA Diaries – Because Why Not?

Welcome to my legendary repository where I heroically push my DSA practice code every day… or at least on the days when VS Code doesn’t crash and life doesn’t act like a segmentation fault.

## 🤹 What’s Happening Here?

**This repo contains:**

1. My daily DSA practice

2. Code written after hours of staring at the screen

3. Occasional bugs (feature, actually)

4. And solutions that somehow worked… I don’t ask why.

## I practice DSA on VS Code, and right before the day ends — when normal people sleep — I push everything here like:

## “Git, ye sambhaal lena… mujhe neend aa rahi hai.”

## 😎 Why This Repo Exists?

**Because consistency > talent.**
*Also because my laptop was starting to judge me.*

### Plus, this repo keeps my code safe from:

1. Accidental deletion

2. Laptop meltdown

3. Me pressing random keys out of frustration

4. And of course… Windows updates.

## 🧩 What You’ll Find

1. Arrays that betrayed me

2. Linked Lists that somehow finally linked

3. Trees that grew sideways

4. Dynamic Programming that made me question life

5. And recursion… infinite recursion.

## 🚀 The Goal

**Become a DSA God.**
*Or at least stop crying over LeetCode medium questions.*

## 📅 Daily Routine (Mostly)

1. Write some code

2. Fix some code

3. Break some code

4. Google 72% of the code

5. Push code

6. Sleep

## 🫡 Final Words

*If any of this code helps you —*
*Congrats, you’re officially more confused than me.*
